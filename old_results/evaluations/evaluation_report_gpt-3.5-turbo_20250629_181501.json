Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs light energy from the sun and uses it to drive the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.\n\nThe overall equation for photosynthesis is:\n\n6CO2 + 6H2O + sunlight → C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nIn this equation, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are converted into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) in the presence of sunlight.\n\nGlucose is a simple sugar that serves as the primary source of energy for plants. It can be used immediately to fuel cellular processes or stored as starch for later use. The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere and is essential for the respiration of plants and animals.\n\nOverall, photosynthesis is a crucial process that allows plants to convert sunlight into usable energy, providing the foundation for the Earth's ecosystems.",
