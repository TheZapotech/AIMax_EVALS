This process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells and is divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions.\n\nIn the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses this energy to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen ions. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct, while the hydrogen ions are used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are energy carriers needed for the next stage of photosynthesis.\n\nIn the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, ATP and NADPH are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This process involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that ultimately produce glucose, which is used by the plant for energy and growth.\n\nOverall, photosynthesis is a vital process that not only provides plants with energy but also produces oxygen, which is essential for the survival of all living organisms on Earth.",
